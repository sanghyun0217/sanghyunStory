jihu was born in a warm country. Thus it was  hard to adapt to the cold Wisconsin weather. 
Jihu  first thought about moving again to a warmer climate. This would have been smart fore Jihu didn't know that the winter would last for many more months. If theres was any hope of lasting the winter, a coat would be needed.
