jihu was born in a warm country. Thus it was  hard to adapt to the cold Wisconsin weather. 
Jihu  first thought about moving again to a warmer climate. This would have been smart fore Jihu didn't know that the winter would last for many more months. If theres was any hope of lasting the winter, a coat would be needed. 
Jihu went to a store that sold winter jackets thinking he should get the best coat possible, since he is going to use it for a long time. However, all the coats in the store were outlandishly expensive. This made Jihu sad.
